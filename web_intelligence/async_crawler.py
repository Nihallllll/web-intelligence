# src/async_crawler.py - FAST async crawler
"""
🚗 THE SUPER FAST WEBSITE VISITOR 🚗

Imagine you need to visit 5 friends' houses to collect toys.

SLOW way (old):
    Go to house 1 → wait → get toy → come back
    Go to house 2 → wait → get toy → come back
    Go to house 3 → wait → get toy → come back
    (Takes 15 minutes!)

FAST way (this code!):
    Send 5 robots to ALL houses at the SAME TIME!
    All robots come back together
    (Takes only 3 minutes!) ⚡

This is called "ASYNC" (asynchronous) - doing many things at once!

Also uses HTTP/2:
    HTTP/1: Like having separate phone calls with each friend
    HTTP/2: Like a GROUP CALL with everyone at once! 📞
